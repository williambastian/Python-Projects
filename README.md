Basic Python Projects

These are basic projects written in Python. They use various modules such as tkinter or sqlite3.

The largest and most detailed project is the Python Live Project: a Board Game Tracker app with CRUD functionality, web scraping, and API functionality, which I created over two week sprint using the Django Framework and Beautiful Soup.

Also included is a basic checkbook app created using the Django framework.

- File Transfer tool with tkinter GUI
- Student database tracker tool
- Checkbook App


# Python Live Project - Board Game Tracker App

    This project allows users to create, update, or delete a personalized list of board games, and scrapes live data from multiple sites to present the user with timely information. This project was created with Python, Django framework, and Beautiful Soup, and tasks were managed using Azure DevOps.

# File Transfer tool - (file_transfer.py)


	This project allows users to transfer batches of files between designated directories. 
	The default setting for this tool only transfers batches of files that were modified within the last 24 hours.
	

# Student Tracker App  
	
	This project demonstrates CRUD functionality using python, tkinter, and sqlite3. 
	Users can select existing users from the GUI, create / update / delete their details, and save them to the associated database.
	This tool also demonstrates warning popup functionality when exiting the tool.

# Checkbook App - Django Framework - (Django_Checkbook_Project)

	
	This project demonstrates the use of the Django framework to develop
	a basic checkbook app. Users can create new sample checking accounts
	with initial balances, enter transactions as deposits or withdrawals,
	and then view their updated balances.
